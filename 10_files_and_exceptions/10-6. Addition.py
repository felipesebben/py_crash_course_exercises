# One common problem when prompting for numerical input occurs when people
# provide text instead of numbers. When you try to convert the input to an int,
# youâ€™ll get a ValueError. Write a program that prompts for two numbers.
# Add them together and print the result. Catch the ValueError if either input
# value is not a number, and print a friendly error message.
# Test yourprogram by entering two numbers and then by entering some text
# instead of a number.

try:
    x = input("Give me a number: ")
    x = int(x)

    y = input("Give me another number: ")
    y = int(y)
except ValueError:
    print("Sorry, I really needed a number.")
else:
    sum = x + y
    print(f"The sum of {x} and {y} us {sum}.")
